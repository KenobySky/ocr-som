According to wikipedia: *"A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map. Self-organizing maps are different from other artificial neural networks in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space."*

This project is based on Heaton, Jeff. Introduction to neural networks with java,2nd ed. Heaton Research. October,2008. , we are attempting to use the OCR with SOM project from the book and improve it to make it more didactic  for students.And also able to run on android.
