This repository is about **Optical Character Recognition using Kohonen Map , also known as self-organizing map (SOM).**

According to wikipedia: *"A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map. Self-organizing maps are different from other artificial neural networks in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space."*

Using Mr Jeff Heaton Book, we used the code of the Self Organizing Map chapter and changed the view to libGDX and we are attempting to make it more didatic for students.

**Its still under development. For now, it works but its not didatic.**
