# **Optical Character Recognition using Kohonen Map (self-organizing map (SOM)).** #
Project based on :
*Heaton, Jeff. Introduction to neural networks with java,2nd ed. Heaton Research. October,2008.[1]*

According to Kohonen (1990, p.1) "...The Self-Organizing map has the special property of effectively creating spatially organized "internal representations" of various features of input signals and their abstractions of various features of input signals and their abstractions" ( Page 1)[2]


This project objective is to use the OCR with SOM project from the book and improve it to make it more didactic  for students.And also able to run on android.
